University Database Automation with Sqlite
Sep 2020 â€“ Oct 2020

I have created Database Automation using SqLite library using Python. My project, which I have programmed as object-based, is a system that can be used by the university administration and can store hundreds of students' information in the database. At the same time, SQL queries such as Add Student, Update Information, Delete Student, List and Special Search can be made via the menu.
